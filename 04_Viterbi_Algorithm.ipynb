    "# The Viterbi Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you’re playing a guessing game: your friend hides a toy and makes a series of noises—“meow,” “woof,” “chirp,” and so on. Your job is to figure out, at each sound, which toy they’re thinking of (cat, dog, bird, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "A naïve approach would be to consider **every possible sequence** of guesses for the entire string of sounds—and then pick the overall best one. If there are many possible toys (hidden states) and your friend makes a long series of noises, that brute-force search becomes exponentially expensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Viterbi algorithm slashes this down via **dynamic programming**:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. States and Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Hidden states**  \n",
    "  Think of each toy (cat, dog, bird, etc.) as a hidden state.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Observations**  \n",
    "  The input sequence is the list of sounds your friend makes.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. DP Table Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "Define a table `V[t][s]` that stores, for each time step `t` and each state `s`, the highest log-probability of any path ending in state `s` after observing the first `t` sounds. In other words, it’s the best score you can get up to time `t` if you assume the hidden state at `t` is `s`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Recurrence Relation\n",
    "\n",
    "At each new time step `t` and for each state `s`:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Look at every possible previous state `r`.\n",
    "2. For each, add:\n",
    "   - The best score at time `t-1` for state `r` (`V[t-1][r]`).\n",
    "   - The log-probability of transitioning from `r` to `s`.\n",
    "3. Take the maximum of those sums.\n",
    "4. Add the log-probability of emitting the observed sound at time `t` from state `s`.\n",
    "5. Store both the maximum score in `V[t][s]` and the corresponding previous state `r` in a backpointer table `BP[t][s]` so you can reconstruct the path later.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Initialization & Termination\n",
    "\n",
    "### Initialization (time step 0)\n",
    "\n",
    "- For each state `s`, compute the score of starting in `s` and emitting the first sound. Store it in `V[0][s]`.  \n",
    "- Set `BP[0][s] = Start` for all `s`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Termination (final time step)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Among all states, pick the one with the highest score at the final time step (including the transition to an “End” state, if your model has one).\n",
    "- Backtrack from that state using `BP` to recover the entire best path.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Time Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Brute-force**: Exponential in sequence length (checking every state sequence).\n",
    "- **Viterbi**: For each time step, you examine all pairs of current and previous states—so it runs in polynomial time (quadratic in the number of states, linear in sequence length).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "By reusing previously computed scores instead of exploring every possible sequence, the Viterbi algorithm turns an intractable search into an efficient dynamic-programming solution—an enormous practical improvement.\n"
